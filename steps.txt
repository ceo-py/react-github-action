 - 1. HOST - with the ip of the your vps server
 - 2. USERNAME - the username of the host that you will use to connect to it 'root'
 - 3. SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - the ssh key you will have to create on you vps. 
        setup on vps: 
            -1 cd ~/.ssh - navigate to
            -2 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'test@test.com' - create ssh key with your email address, example name of the key "filename"
            -3 get the secret key you just generated test and save inside SSH_PRIVATE_KEY

- 4. Got to github settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key and add the public key your just create from the step above from filename.pub.
- 5. cat filename.pub >> authorized_keys - Add the public ssh we just create inside the vps authorized_keys for github can connect to vps
- 6. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" then ssh-add ~/.ssh/filename

if access problem add
    - 7. chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    - 8 chmod 600 ~/.ssh/filename
